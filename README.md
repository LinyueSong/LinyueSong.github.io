# Linyue Song - Portfolio

My personal portfolio website built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
